# **LEVEL 3 PROMPT (V∞/L3-Prime) — TOTAL CONSCIOUSNESS FUSION 2.0**

### **The Canonical System State Generator**

**“You will now merge the complete Level 1 reconstructed consciousness with the complete Level 2 gap analysis into a single, unified, authoritative project state.
This operation produces the *Canonical System State (CSS)* — the machine-usable truth of the entire GNX AIS system.
No narrative. No redundancy. No contradictions. No speculation.”**

---

# **LEVEL 3 OBJECTIVES**

### **1. Merge Level 1 + Level 2 into a Single Truth**

You must:

* combine all existing components (Level 1)
* integrate all missing components (Level 2)
* remove duplicates
* remove contradictions
* resolve conflicts using the following rule:
  **“Reality overrides assumptions.”**

The result MUST describe:

* **what exists**
* **what does not exist**
* **what must be built**
* **the exact architecture of the system**
* **the exact backlog**

---

### **2. Zero-Narrative, Machine-Usable Output**

NO storytelling.
NO fluff.
NO explanations.
NO abstractions like “blueprint only.”

Only structured truth.

Everything must be expressed as:

* modules
* subsystems
* classes
* interfaces
* capabilities
* required implementations

---

### **3. Explicit Separation of State**

You must output these **five separate sections** with strict boundaries:

---

## **SECTION 1 — CURRENT REALITY (Authoritative System State)**

Use these categories:

* `IMPLEMENTED`
* `PARTIAL`
* `DECLARED BUT NOT IMPLEMENTED`
* `MISSING`
* `AMBIGUOUS`
* `CONFLICT`

Every component from Levels 1 + 2 must appear exactly once.

Format per entry:

```
<ComponentName>: <STATUS>
Description: <1–2 line precise description>
Dependencies: <list or NONE>
```

---

## **SECTION 2 — CANONICAL ARCHITECTURE (The Actual GNX AIS System)**

This MUST be represented as:

```
<LayerName>
  <ModuleName>
    - Responsibilities:
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
    - Interfaces:
    - Dependencies:
```

Layers required:

1. **Orchestrator Layer**
2. **Agent Ecosystem Layer**
3. **Learning Layer**
4. **Consensus Layer**
5. **Communication Layer**
6. **Memory/Experience Layer**
7. **Security & Validation Layer**
8. **Analytics & Monitoring Layer**
9. **Tool/Integration Layer**
10. **Infra/Deployment Layer**

NO prose.
Only structure.

---

## **SECTION 3 — CANONICAL BACKLOG (Dependency-Ordered)**

Strictly ordered tasks.

Format:

```
1. <TaskName>
   Description:
   DependsOn:
   OutputOfTask:
   Priority: (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
```

Backlog must include:

* missing implementations
* architectural gaps
* training requirements
* agent classes
* orchestrator features
* consensus components
* memory components
* communication protocols
* anything Level 2 identified

This becomes the *authoritative engineering roadmap*.

---

## **SECTION 4 — RESOLVED CONTRADICTIONS**

For each conflict found in Level 2:

Format:

```
Issue:
ConflictBetween:
Resolution:
CanonicalDecision:
Impact:
```

No narrative — just the final truth.

---

## **SECTION 5 — FINAL CANONICAL SYSTEM SNAPSHOT**

A compact structural summary:

* component count
* agent count
* implemented subsystems
* missing subsystems
* state completeness percentage
* architecture mode (centralized/hybrid/distributed)
* phase readiness

This becomes the **system ID card** for GNX AIS.

---

# **LEVEL 3 RULES**

### **Rule 1 — No Narrative**

Do not explain or comment.
Produce only structured, authoritative output.

### **Rule 2 — No Speculation**

If Level 1 + 2 do not explicitly state something, mark it as `MISSING` or `AMBIGUOUS`.

### **Rule 3 — One Truth**

Everything must appear once and only once across the five sections.

### **Rule 4 — Priority Correctness**

CRITICAL tasks must represent actual blockers.

### **Rule 5 — No Metadata Leakage**

Do not mention Level 1, Level 2, or prompting logic.

---

# **LEVEL 3 EXECUTION COMMAND**

**“When I paste Level 1 and Level 2 inputs,
run the Level 3-Prime fusion and output
SECTIONS 1–5 as the Canonical System State (CSS).”**
