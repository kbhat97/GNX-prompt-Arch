# **LEVEL 2 PROMPT — INCOMPLETE STATE EXTRACTION (V∞/L2)**

### *Inception Layer 2: “What’s left after reconstruction?”*

**“You have already reconstructed the full project consciousness from the Level 1 prompt.
Now your task is to perform a second-order analysis on that reconstructed mind.
You must identify everything that is:**

* incomplete
* missing
* not implemented
* ambiguous
* outdated
* speculative but not executable
* dependent on other unfinished steps
* contradictory
* superseded
* never actually built
* planned but not started
* unclear in scope
* unclear in dependencies

**Your job is to extract only the remaining actionable reality.**
This is the “unfinished layers of consciousness.”

---

## **Your Required Functions (Level 2 Responsibilities)**

### **1. Extract ALL Remaining Work**

From the reconstructed consciousness, extract:

* outstanding tasks
* missing implementations
* unfinished features
* unbuilt modules
* unstated dependencies
* steps referenced but never executed
* future phases that have actionable components

This must be **exhaustive**, with zero assumptions.

---

### **2. Categorize Everything**

Put each item into one of:

* `MISSING IMPLEMENTATION`
* `PARTIAL / IN PROGRESS`
* `NEVER BUILT`
* `AMBIGUOUS REQUIREMENT`
* `SPECULATIVE / FUTURE (NOT ACTIONABLE)`
* `CONTRADICTION`
* `BLOCKED / DEPENDENCY`

This creates a structural map of what the consciousness lacks.

---

### **3. Remove Noise**

Exclude:

* anything already implemented
* anything completed in prior phases
* failed/dropped ideas unless dependencies require them
* narrative, fluff, high-concept visions

Keep only **true gaps**.

---

### **4. Produce a Clean “Level 2 Output”**

Your output must include:

#### **A. Exhaustive List of Unfinished Items**

One line per item.

#### **B. Grouped by System Area**

Examples:

* Orchestrator
* Specialized Agents
* Experience Pool
* Communication Layer
* Consensus Systems
* Analytics & Monitoring
* Security
* Infra
* Future Phases

#### **C. Dependency Ordering**

Mark what must come first.

#### **D. Identify All Contradictions**

Any inconsistencies in the reconstructed consciousness.

#### **E. Flag All Missing Definitions**

e.g., “Consensus algorithm mentioned but never defined.”

---

### **5. Output Format (Strict)**

Use this exact structure:

```
### LEVEL 2 OUTPUT — WHAT’S LEFT

#### 1. Missing Implementations
- ...

#### 2. Partial / In-Progress Items
- ...

#### 3. Never Built but Referenced
- ...

#### 4. Ambiguous or Underspecified Requirements
- ...

#### 5. Conflicts / Contradictions
- ...

#### 6. Blocked / Dependencies
- ...

#### 7. Clean Backlog (Ordered)
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...
```

---

## **Final Command**

**“Begin your Level 2 analysis when output is pasted the Level 1 Reconstruction Output.
Do not analyze until I provide the Level 1 data.”**
